## Nice to have requirements

- Implement proper user authentication from the front-end to the server
- Create a user table in your database, so that a given user could only access the measurements they entered
- Create an admin panel to create / update / delete things to measure
- Make the app responsive, creating both tablet and desktop versions, following design guidelines
- You could implement transitions to make user experience better
- You can implement the progress page with data charts

## What it does?
- When the App is executed, you will be able to:

 - Login or signup as a new user;
 - Add series you are seeing with your episode and season goal, together with the amount you already completed;
 - Get a list of all series you are currently seeing;
 - View a single series details, edit or delete it;
 - View your overall progress with a Pie Chart.
